# Password Generator

## Description
Using Javascript, the application was enhanced by allowing users to generate random passwords for their security needs. Users must specify a character length between 8 and 128 characters, and choose at least one character type: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special. A password would then be randomly generated onto the screen for their use.

## Usage
First, click the Generate Password button. Then, follow the prompts. Click OK to accept use of a character type, and cancel to not use a character type. When the prompts are finished, a password will appear on the screen for you to use :)
